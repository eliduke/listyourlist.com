# This file should ensure the existence of records required to run the application in every environment (production,
# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Example:

Spain as we know it know came from this marraige. Wikipedia says this: "Spaniards tend to call the language español (Spanish) when contrasting it to languages of other states, such as in a list with French (francés), English (inglés), German (alemán), Chinese (chino), and so on. Castellano (Castilian) by contrast, is more often used when contrasting the language with other regional languages of Spain: Aragonese, Asturian, Basque, Catalan, Extremaduran, Galician, and so on. In this manner, the Spanish Constitution of 1978 uses the term castellano to define the official language of the whole State, opposed to las demás lenguas españolas" Now, because of Francisco Franco's rule that only Castillian be used during his reign, some Spaniards are very proud of their regional languages (such as Catalan, Galician, Basque etc.) and might take offense that castellano = spanish. Outside of Spain (i.e. Latin America, USA) most people don't give a fart and call it Spanish. This reply was much longer than I had first intended.^, created_at: "2006-06-26 07:37:15 UTC" },
